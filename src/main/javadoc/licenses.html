    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]

    <div class="contentContainer" id="LGPL_2.1_License_div">
      <h3><a id="SEC2">Preamble</a></h3>

      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
      freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
      Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
      free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
      specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
      Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
      can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
      this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
      strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
      not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
      you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
      for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
      it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
      it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
      these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
      rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
      you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
      code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
      complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
      with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
      it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
      library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
      there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
      modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
      that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
      author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
      introduced by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
      any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
      effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
      restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
      any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
      consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
      ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
      General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
      is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
      this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
      libraries into non-free programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
      a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
      combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
      General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
      entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
      Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
      the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
      does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
      Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
      of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
      are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
      libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
      special circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
      a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
      allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
      library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
      case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
      software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
      free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
      non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
      operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
      system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
      users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
      linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
      that program using a modified version of the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
      "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
      former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
      be combined with the library in order to run.
      </p>

      <h3><a id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
      DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>


      <p>
      <strong>0.</strong>
      This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
      program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
      other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
      this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
      Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      </p>
      <p>
        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
      prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
      (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
      which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
      Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
      copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
      portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
      straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
      included without limitation in the term "modification".)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
      all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
      interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
      and installation of the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
      running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
      such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
      on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
      writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
      and what the program that uses the Library does.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>1.</strong>
      You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
      complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
      you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
      appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
      warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
      Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
      fee.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>2.</strong>
      You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
      distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong>
             The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>
        <li><strong>b)</strong>
             You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
             stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>

        <li><strong>c)</strong>
             You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
             charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>

        <li><strong>d)</strong>
             If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
             table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
             the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
             is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
             in the event an application does not supply such function or
             table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
             its purpose remains meaningful.
             <p>
             (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
             a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
             application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
             application-supplied function or table used by this function must
             be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
             root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
      distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
      based on the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
      this License.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>3.</strong>
      You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
      License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
      this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
      that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
      instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
      ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
      that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
      these notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
      that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
      subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
      the Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>4.</strong>
      You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
      derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
      under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
      it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
      must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
      medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
      source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
      distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>5.</strong>
      A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
      Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
      linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
      work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
      therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
      creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
      contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
      library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
      Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
      that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
      derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
      Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
      linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
      threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
      structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
      functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
      file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
      work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
      Library will still fall under Section 6.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
      distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
      Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
      whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>6.</strong>
      As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
      link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
      work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
      under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
      modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
      engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
      this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
      during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
      copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
      directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
      of these things:
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
          corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
          including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
          executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
          then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
          modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the
          contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
          be able to recompile the application to use the modified
          definitions.)</li>

          <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
          for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that
          (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
          user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
          modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
          work was made with.</li>

          <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
          valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
          materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
          than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>

          <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
          offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
          access to copy the above specified materials from the same
          place.</li>

          <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
          a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
          a copy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
      Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
      reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
      the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
      the executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
      restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
      accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
      use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
      distribute.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work
      based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
      other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
      such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
      the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
      otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
          of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
          library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of
          the Sections above.</li>

          <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
          library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
          Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
          form of the same work.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
      or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
      License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
      with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
      terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
      received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
      their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
      compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>9.</strong>
      You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
      signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
      distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
      modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
      Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
      the Library or works based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>10.</strong>
      Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
      Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
      original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
      subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
      restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
      this License.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>11.</strong>
      If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
      excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
      distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
      may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
      all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
      the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
      refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
      and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
      integrity of the free software distribution system which is
      implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
      generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
      to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
      impose that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
      be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>12.</strong>
      If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
      original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
      an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
      so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
      excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
      written in the body of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>13.</strong>
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
      versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
      Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
      but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
      "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
      conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
      the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
      license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
      the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>14.</strong>
      If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
      programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
      write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
      copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
      Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
      decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
      of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
      and reuse of software generally.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>15.</strong>
      BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
      WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
      EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
      OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
      LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
      THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>16.</strong>
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
      WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
      AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
      FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR

      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      </pre>

      <h3 id="GPL_preamble"><a id="GPL_SEC2">Preamble</a></h3>

      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
      freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
      License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
      software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
      General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
      using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
      the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
      your programs, too.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
      this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
      if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
      in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
      </p>

      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
      These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
      distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
      gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
      you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
      source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
      rights.
      </p>

      <p>
        We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
      (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
      distribute and/or modify the software.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
      that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
      software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
      want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
      that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
      authors' reputations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
      patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
      program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
      program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
      patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.
      </p>


      <h3 id="GPL_terms"><a id="GPL_SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>


      <p id="GPL_section0">
      <strong>0.</strong>
       This License applies to any program or other work which contains
      a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
      under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
      refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
      means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
      that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
      either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
      language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
      the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      </p>

      <p>
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
      running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
      is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
      Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
      Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section1">
      <strong>1.</strong>
       You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
      source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
      conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
      copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
      notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
      and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
      along with the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
      you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </p>

      <p id="PGL_section2">
      <strong>2.</strong>
       You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
      distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong>a)</strong>
            You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          </dd>
        <dt></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong>b)</strong>
            You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
            whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
            part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
            parties under the terms of this License.
          </dd>
        <dt></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong>c)</strong>
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
            announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
            notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
            a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
            these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
            License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
            does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
            the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
      on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
      </p>

      <p>
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
      with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
      the scope of this License.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section3">
      <strong>3.</strong>
       You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
      under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
      Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
      </p>

      <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
      <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

      <dl>
        <dt></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong>a)</strong>
            Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
            source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
            1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          </dd>
        <dt></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong>b)</strong>
            Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
            years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
            cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
            distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
            customarily used for software interchange; or,
          </dd>
        <dt></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong>c)</strong>
            Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
            to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
            allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
            received the program in object code or executable form with such
            an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
      code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
      control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
      special exception, the source code distributed need not include
      anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
      form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
      operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
      itself accompanies the executable.
      </p>

      <p>
      If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
      access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
      access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
      distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section4">
      <strong>4.</strong>
       You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
      except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
      otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
      void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
      However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
      this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
      parties remain in full compliance.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section5">
      <strong>5.</strong>
       You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
      signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
      distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
      modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
      the Program or works based on it.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section6">
      <strong>6.</strong>
       Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
      original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
      these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
      restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
      this License.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section7">
      <strong>7.</strong>
       If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
      excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
      distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
      may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
      all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
      the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
      refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
      any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
      apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
      circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
      integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
      implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
      generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
      to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
      impose that choice.
      </p>

      <p>
      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
      be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p>

      <p id="GPL_section8">
      <strong>8.</strong>
       If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
      original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
      may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
      those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
      countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
      the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

      of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
      be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
      address new problems or concerns.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
      later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
      either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
      Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
      this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
      Foundation.

      <strong>10.</strong>
       If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
      programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
      to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
      Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
      make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
      of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
      of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

      <strong>11.</strong>
       BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
      FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
      OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
      PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED

      <strong>12.</strong>
       IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
      REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
      INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

      YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
